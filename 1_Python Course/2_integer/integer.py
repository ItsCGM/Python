x=int(input("enter the value of x: ")) #here int is used to make the input as interger
print(type(x)) #type is used to change the type of the input, like a integer to a string or a string to a integer, etc.
y=int(input("enter the value of y: "))
print(type(y))
print("the value of x+y is ",x+y) # additon
print("the value of x-y is ",x-y) #subtraction
print("the value of x*y is ",x*y) #multiplication
print("the value of x/y is ",x/y) #division & so on
print("the value of x//y is ",x//y) #
print("the value of x%y is ",x%y) #returns the remainder
